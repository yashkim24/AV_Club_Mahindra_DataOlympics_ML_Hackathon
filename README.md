## Problem Statement

### Food & Beverages Spend Prediction in Club Mahindra Resorts

Club Mahindra makes significant revenue from Food and Beverages (F&B) sales in their resorts.The members of Club Mahindra are offered a wide variety of items in either buffet or A la carte form.Following are some benefits that the model to predict the spend by a member in their next visit to a resort will bring:

* **Predicting the F&B spend of a member in a resort would help in improving the pre-sales during resort booking through web and mobile app**
* **Targeted campaigns to suit the member taste and preference of F&B**
* **Providing members in the resort with a customized experience and offers**
* **Help resort kitchen to plan the inventory and food quantity to be prepared in advance**

Given the information related to resort,club member,reservation etc.
The task is to predict average spend per room night on food and beverages for the each reservation in the test set.

* sample_submission.csv contains the submission format for the predictions against the test set. A single csv needs to be submitted as a solution.
 

### Evaluation Metric
